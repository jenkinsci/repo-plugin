  <p>Control polling and parametrization support.  By default both are disabled.</p>
  <p>When polling is enabled, you can enable the Jenkins SCM polling
     option to make Jenkins to periodically check against changes in
     the repo.  This is a relatively expensive operation, though.
  <p>When parameters are enabled, parameters and other environment
     variables can be used when defining the repository url, branch,
     manifest file, mirror directory, jobs, and local manifest.
     The parameters can be used anywhere within the text, so that you
     can e.g. construct the <code>local_manifest.xml</code> content
     from several bits and pieces.</p>
  <p>Please note that polling and parametrizing are incompatible at
     the moment.  If you enable parameters, then any attempt to use
     polling will cause a run time error, and if you enable polling,
     then any environment variables in the input fields will be
     taken literally and not expanded.</p>
