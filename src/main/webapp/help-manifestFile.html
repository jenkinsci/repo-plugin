    The initial manifest file to use while initializing the repo. This is passed to repo as
    <code>repo init -m <i>manifestFile</i></code>.  If a manifest file is not specified,
    repo uses the default of "default.xml".
    <p>
    It is also possible to specify the manifest file by setting the "OVERRIDE_MANIFEST" build variable.
    OVERRIDE_MANIFEST only applies when checking out the source code and not during polling. It's purpose is
    to allow fan-out build configurations where multiple slaves build the same version of the source in parallel.

    To generate a manifest file records the revision of every git repository use this command.
    <code> repo manifest -r -o ${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}.xml </code>

    N.B. It is preferable to specify the manifest revision via the BRANCH parameter where the revision is a tag
    created by the parent build.
